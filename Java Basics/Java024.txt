
JDK -> JRE And Devlopment Tools
JRE -> JVM and Libraries
JVM 


How is our Code Running
Source Code(.java) -> Compiler -> Byte Code(.class) -> JVM -> Native Code
                       Javac                       OS, Hardware


Native Code is different for windows, mac, etc. It is in form of 0s 1s
Byte code is same

So java is portable language


Compilation compiles code and check code is error less
