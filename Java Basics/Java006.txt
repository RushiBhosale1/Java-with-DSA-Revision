Data Types in java
Java is Typed Language
JS is not typed language

1.Primitive - 
Already present in java. We don't want to create it.
byte, short, char, boolean, int, long, float, double
All datatypes start with small case
Boolean true,false

2.Non-Primitive - 
Not present in Java. We have to create it.
String, Array, Class, Object, interface 

Bytes:
each byte has 8 bits
blocks are made of this bytes

Why Datatype?
Size of data types are different for each
byte  1 byte(-128 to 127)
short 2 bytes
char  2 bytes  ('a', 'b', 'A', '@', '#', etc)
boolean 1 bytes
int 4 bytes   (-2B to +2B)
long 8 bytes
float 4 bytes
double 8 bytes
