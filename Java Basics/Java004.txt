Variables in java
Variables are those whose values can change
eg a=10, b=5

Identifiers:
Name of variable, function, print, println, etc
in above example a and b are identifiers

Literal
are those whose values can't change
eg 2,5,6,a,$,

Memory:
when variable is created then block of memory is allocated and we can say name of block is variable name.
Address is also there for each block eg 1000,1001 it is very huge address
It is not neccessary that each block has same size
